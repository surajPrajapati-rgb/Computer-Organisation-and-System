1. Write a verilog code and testbench to realise the following logic gates with NAND and NOR gates. 
a) AND
b) OR
c) NOT
d) XOR
e) XNOR
You need to upload 20 files. (5 design files with NAND gates, 5 test benches for NAND gates, 5 design files with NOR gates, 5 test benches for NOR gates) 
Every File will have 5 marks. Total 20*5=100 marks.
